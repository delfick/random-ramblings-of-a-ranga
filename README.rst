===========

To setup do a clone and run ``npm i``

Then to run in dev mode::

    > npm run dev

And visit my website at http://localhost:3000. The HMR in sveltekit is magic and
seems to actually "just work"!

To run what gets deployed to prod::

    > npm run build && npm run preview

Also viewed at http://localhost:3000. But no HMR on this!
